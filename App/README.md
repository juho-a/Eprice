# Eprice App

The Eprice App is a containerized application that allows users to view the market price of electricity in Finland, both current and historical. The app is built with a modern tech stack, including a Svelte frontend, a FastAPI backend, a PostgreSQL database, and various tools for testing and data management.

## Features

- **Electricity Price Viewer**: View current and historical electricity prices in Finland.
- **Svelte Frontend**: A modern, responsive UI built with Svelte and Vite.
- **FastAPI Backend**: A Python-based backend for handling API requests and business logic.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: A robust database for storing electricity price data.
- **Flyway Migrations**: Manage database schema changes with ease.
- **Testing**: End-to-end tests with Playwright and backend API tests with Pytest.
- **Chat Engine**: A chat-based interface for interacting with the app.
- **Data Loading**: Load and update electricity price data into the database using scripts in a dedicated container.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**: Install Docker Desktop or Docker CLI.
- **Deno**: Required for local development of the frontend (see `client/README.md`).

---

### Running the App

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd Eprice
    ```

2. Build and start the containers:
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```

3. Access the services:

* Frontend: http://localhost:5173
* Backend: http://localhost:8000

4. To stop the containers:
    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

### Testing


1. Run Playwright tests:
    ```bash
    docker compose run --rm --entrypoint=npx e2e-tests playwright test
    ```

2. Run Pytest for backend API (using uv inside the container):
    ```bash
    docker compose run backend-tests [uv run pytest]
    ```

### Environment Variables

* Use `.env.local` for local development (gitignored)

* Use `project.env` for containerrized development

* To inspect environment variables inside a container:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it <container_name> bash
    printenv
    ```

## Additional notes

**Install docker and docker compose**. Maybe easiest to just install docker desktop, especially on windows.

**Postgres is not needed on local machine** (unless you want to run outside containers).

The compose.yaml and the individual Dockerfiles are sufficient to run the App. Docker does the installing for the containers. But you can still run `deno install --allow-scripts`, if you want to run on local host. On windows, after running deno install, `node_modules/` that are loaded into client should not be copied into the container -- the container is using arch-linux as base image. You can either remove those, or add your own `.dockerignore` file.

Run using docker compose:

`docker compose up --build` (no need to build everytime)

You can also simply `ctrl+C` to shut down the containers, or

`docker compose down` to tear down.


### **About environment variables**

Keep private information private, preferably :-). You can use `.env.local` convention, and keep them gitignored. For public api keys, while developing, we can all get our own api keys.

**If you are unsure what environment variables are loaded on your container launch -- either by docker from project.env, or by services using other tools, like dotenv -- you can always go inside the container to check:**

```
docker compose up -d <service_name> # launch the container

docker exec -it <container_name> bash # go into cmdline inside

(container): printenv # or echo etc.
```

**For developing client:** There is a sort of a bug in the denolands alpine image, which prevents us from installing with optional flags -- in our case `deno install --allow-scripts`. This means that the node modules need to be copied from local. This is not an issue if you are using linux (or wsl2 on Windows). Later, there might be a change in the client's base image later on to fix this issue.

And note that the container names are not necessarily same as the service name (they are derived from it though); you can check running cont's with `docker <container> ps`.

### Running without Docker

Can be done, but needlessly cumbersome. Ask Paavo for the how.


### Starting a new client build from scratch

If you want to start the client build from scratch, for example with typescript checking enabled, run:

```bash
deno run -A npm:sv@latest create client
```

from the root directory, and choose from the given options. For this project, we have used the most minimal build setup (SveleteKit minimal, no TS typechecking, nothing added, with deno itself for dependency management).
