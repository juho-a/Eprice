"""
user_repository.py defines the UserRepository class for user-related database operations in the Eprice backend.

The repository provides asynchronous methods for:
- Retrieving user records by email.
- Creating new user accounts with hashed passwords and verification codes.
- Verifying user email addresses using verification codes.
- Updating verification codes for users.

All operations interact directly with a PostgreSQL database using asyncpg for asynchronous access.
This repository is intended to be used by service and controller layers to abstract database logic
from business and API logic.

Dependencies:
- asyncpg for asynchronous PostgreSQL operations.

Intended Usage:
- Instantiate with a database connection URL.
- Use in authentication and user management services for all user-related database actions.
