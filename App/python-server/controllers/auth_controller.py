""" auth_controller.py defines the authentication controller for the Eprice backend API using FastAPI.
It provides endpoints for user registration, login, logout, email verification, and resending verification codes.
The controller manages authentication logic, JWT token handling, and cookie management for session persistence.

Key Endpoints:

POST /api/auth/register: Registers a new user and sends a confirmation email. Handles duplicate email errors.
POST /api/auth/login: Authenticates a user, checks email verification status, and issues a JWT token as an HTTP-only cookie.
GET /api/auth/logout: Logs out the user by deleting the authentication cookie.
POST /api/auth/verify: Verifies a user's email using a code sent to their email address.
POST /api/auth/resend: Resends the email verification code to the user.
The controller uses dependency-injected service and repository layers for business logic and database access.
It also provides a JWT middleware factory for protecting private routes by validating JWT tokens from cookies and attaching user info to the request state.

Error handling is performed by setting appropriate HTTP status codes and returning informative messages for frontend handling.
All endpoints expect and return JSON payloads.

Dependencies:

FastAPI for API routing and response handling.
jose for JWT encoding/decoding.
asyncpg for async PostgreSQL operations.
Custom modules for user models, authentication services, and configuration.
This controller is intended to be used as part of the FastAPI application and imported into the main app router. """
