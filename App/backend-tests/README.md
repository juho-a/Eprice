### Endpoint tests

You need to have the Eprice -app running if you want to run the tests. So call `docker compose up` to run the server (or with `-d server` flag, since front is not needed for these tests). If you run `docker compose up --build`, the backend tests **will not be started** as they are defined as a "profile" in compose file.

To run the tests, first build the container with `docker compose build` inside the backend-tests, or just by adding the `--build` and `-d` flags:

```
docker compose up --build -d backend-tests
```

You can also run them in various other ways, e.g., jointly with every other container:

```
docker compose up --profile backend-tests
```

If you do it this way, and we add tests that depend on the loaded data in the database, this can cause issues -- we need to specify in the compose file that the backend-tests depends on `database: service_healthy`.

You can also run the tests with

```
docker compose run backend-tests
```

but these will leave a "orphan" containers behind -- these can be removed with `--remove-orphans` flag. Docker will warn you is this is happening, and in any case it is good practice to keep an eye on dockers resource usage and dangling containers:

```
docker ps # running containers
docker ps -a # all containers
docker inspect <container_name_or_id>
docker stats # resource usage
docker container prune # remove stopped containers (it prompts you)
docker system prune # remove unused images, networks (and volumes)
```
