### Client/front template for Eprice app

You need to have deno installed: https://docs.deno.com/runtime/

* missing project.env -- ask Paavo for this.

* run this with docker compose.

* first run `deno install --allow-scripts` in `client/` and `e2e-tests/` directories. This is likely to change in the future, but for now the denoland's alpine base image does not allow installing with optional flags.

**CHANGE**: Running deno install locally is now optional.

# Eprice Frontend

This is the frontend for the Eprice application, built with Svelte. It displays real-time and historical electricity prices for users in a clear and interactive way.

## Features

- **Current Price Display:** Shows the current hour’s electricity price.
- **Daily & Weekly Averages:** Calculates and displays average prices for today and the past week.
- **Interactive Chart:** Visualizes price data over time.
- **Date Range Table:** Lets users fetch and view prices for a custom date range.
- **Responsive UI:** Built with Svelte components for a modern, mobile-friendly experience.
- **User Authentication:** Register, login, verify, and remove accounts.
- **Production/Consumption Comparison:** View and compare electricity production and consumption data.
- **Theme Switching:** Change the UI theme from the footer.
- **ChatBot:** Chat with a bot when logged in.

## Main Components

- src/routes/**+page.svelte**  
  The main landing page. Fetches price data, calculates averages, and renders:
  - `PriceBall` components for current, daily, and weekly prices.
  - `MainChart` for visualizing price trends.

- src/components/layout/**PriceBall.svelte**  
  A reusable component to display a price value with a heading and optional timestamp.

- src/routes/price/**+page.svelte**  
  A page for selecting a custom date range and viewing a table and chart of prices.

- src/routes/pricetable/**+page.svelte**  
  Lets users select a date range and view a paginated table of prices.

- src/routes/epc/**+page.svelte**  
  Shows production, consumption, and price data with interactive charts and filters.

- src/components/layout/**Header.svelte**  
  Navigation bar with links that adapt based on authentication state and user role.

- src/components/layout/**Footer.svelte**  
  Footer with theme-switching buttons.

- src/components/layout/**User.svelte**  
  Displays the currently logged-in user's email.

- src/components/layout/**Clock.svelte**  
  Shows the current time, updating every second.

- **API Helpers (data-api.js)**  
  Functions for fetching price data from the backend API, including:
  - `readPriceRange(start, end)` for fetching prices in a date range.
  - `readData()` and `readPublicData()` for other data endpoints.

- **State Management**  
  - `usePricesState` and `useUserState` provide reactive state for prices and user info across the app.

## Data Flow

1. **Fetching:**  
   On page load, the app fetches price data from the backend API.

2. **Processing:**  
   The frontend calculates the current price, daily average, and weekly average.

3. **Display:**  
   Data is shown in `PriceBall` components and a chart. Users can also view a table of prices for a selected date range, and compare production/consumption data.

## Authentication

- Users can register, login, verify their email, and remove their account via forms in the `/auth/[action]` route.
- Authentication state is reflected in the header and enables additional features (like ChatBot).

## Theming

- Users can switch between several color themes using buttons in the footer. The selected theme is applied to the whole app.

## Testing

- **Playwright** is used for end-to-end testing.  
  Test files are located in `../../e2e-tests/tests/`.
