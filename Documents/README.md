## Documents and materials for Eprice project

Documents and diagrams in this folder describe different aspects of Eprice app. The files have also been parsed and saved in the database in machine readable format. The project/developer chat uses them as context information.

### Sequence diagrams

Install vscode sequance diagram -extension (see it's documentation, and https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/ for examples).

You can open preview in vscode, and export as png/svg.

### class diagrams

Install PlanUML extension, and install Graphviz:

`sudo apt install graphviz` (on linux)

You might also need java/jre, which you very likely already have -- if you can't render these, try googling the solution.
