## Documents and materials for demo session at Taitotalo

Put everything we need for the first session at Taitotalo.

### Sequence diagrams

Install vscode sequance diagram -extension (see it's documentation, and https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/ for examples).

You can open preview in vscode, and export as png/svg.


### class diagrams

Install PlanUML extension, and install Graphviz:

`sudo apt install graphviz` (on linux)

You might also need java/jre, which you very likely already have -- if you can't render these, try googling the solution.
