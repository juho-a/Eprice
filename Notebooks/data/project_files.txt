  "./App/README.md": "# Eprice App\n\nThe Eprice App is a containerized application that allows users to view the market price of electricity in Finland, both current and historical. The app is built with a modern tech stack, including a Svelte frontend, a FastAPI backend, a PostgreSQL database, and various tools for testing and data management.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Electricity Price Viewer**: View current and historical electricity prices in Finland.\n- **Svelte Frontend**: A modern, responsive UI built with Svelte and Vite.\n- **FastAPI Backend**: A Python-based backend for handling API requests and business logic.\n- **PostgreSQL Database**: A robust database for storing electricity price data.\n- **Flyway Migrations**: Manage database schema changes with ease.\n- **Testing**: End-to-end tests with Playwright and backend API tests with Pytest.\n- **User chat**: A chat-based interface to help with the functionalities of the app.\n- **Data Loading**: Load and update electricity price data into the database using scripts in a dedicated container.\n\n---\n\n## Project Structure\n.\n\n ├── README.md # Root README file\n\n ├── compose.yaml # Docker Compose configuration \n \n ├── user-chat/ # Chat engine service \n \n ├── client/ # Svelte frontend service\n \n ├── data-preparation/ # Scripts and data for populating the database\n \n ├── database-migrations/ # Flyway migration scripts \n \n ├── e2e-tests/ # Playwright end-to-end tests\n \n ├── python-server/ # FastAPI backend service\n \n └── project.env # Environment variables for the project\n\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**: Install Docker Desktop or Docker CLI.\n- **Deno**: Required for local development of the frontend (see `client/README.md`), and package management.\n\nAny libraries needed in the containers are installed automatically using requirements or other configuration files. `uv` is preferable package manager also inside containers, but pip is used as fallback in some cases.\n\n### Database Persistence\n\nTo ensure your PostgreSQL database data is persisted locally (so it is not lost when containers are stopped or removed), you need to create a directory for the database files and set the correct permissions:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p ./pgdata\nchmod 700 ./pgdata\nsudo chown -R 999:999 ./pgdata\n```\n\n- `mkdir -p ./pgdata` creates the directory if it doesn't exist.\n- `chmod 700 ./pgdata` sets secure permissions (Postgres default).\n- `sudo chown -R 999:999 ./pgdata` sets ownership to the default Postgres user inside the container (UID 999).\n\n**Note:**  \nIf you change to a custom Postgres image or user, check the UID/GID with:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm <root/image:version> id postgres\n```\n(here we have root=reinikp2 and image=pgvector-database, and version=v1)\n\nand adjust the `chown` command accordingly.\n\n### Running the App\n\n1. Clone the repository:\n    ```bash\n    git clone <repository-url>\n    cd Eprice\n    ```\n\n2. Build and start the containers:\n    ```bash\n    docker compose up --build\n    ```\n\n3. Access the services:\n\n* Frontend: http://localhost:5173\n* Backend: http://localhost:8000\n\n4. To stop the containers:\n    ```bash\n    docker compose down\n    ```\n\n### Testing\n\n\n1. Run Playwright tests:\n    ```bash\n    docker compose run --rm --entrypoint=npx e2e-tests playwright test\n    ```\n\n2. Run Pytest for backend API (using uv inside the container):\n    ```bash\n    docker compose run backend-tests [uv run pytest]\n    ```\n\n### Environment Variables\n\n* Use `.env.local` for local development (gitignored)\n\n* Use `project.env` for containerrized development\n\n* To inspect environment variables inside a container:\n    ```bash\n    docker exec -it <container_name> bash\n    printenv\n    ```\n\n### Services overview\n\n1. Frontend (Client)\nBuilt with Svelte and Vite.\nLocated in the client/ directory.\nSee client/README.md for more details.\n\n2.

Maybe easiest to just install docker desktop, especially on windows.\n\n**Postgres is not needed on local machine** (unless you want to run outside containers).\n\nThe compose.yaml and the individual Dockerfiles are sufficient to run the App. Docker does the installing for the containers. But you can still run `deno install --allow-scripts`, if you want to run on local host. On windows, after running deno install, `node_modules/` that are loaded into client should not be copied into the container -- the container is using arch-linux as base image. You can either remove those, or add your own `.dockerignore` file.\n\nRun using docker compose:\n\n`docker compose up --build` (no need to build everytime)\n\nYou can also simply `ctrl+C` to shut down the containers, or\n\n`docker compose down` to tear down.\n\n\n### **About environment variables**\n\nKeep private information private, preferably :-). You can use `.env.local` convention, and keep them gitignored. For public api keys, while developing, we can all get our own api keys.\n\n**If you are unsure what environment variables are loaded on your container launch -- either by docker from project.env, or by services using other tools, like dotenv -- you can always go inside the container to check:**\n\n```\ndocker compose up -d <service_name> # launch the container\n\ndocker exec -it <container_name> bash # go into cmdline inside\n\n(container): printenv # or echo etc.\n```\n\n**For developing client:** There is a sort of a bug in the denolands alpine image, which prevents us from installing with optional flags -- in our case `deno install --allow-scripts`. This means that the node modules need to be copied from local. This is not an issue if you are using linux (or wsl2 on Windows). Later, there might be a change in the client's base image later on to fix this issue.\n\nAnd note that the container names are not necessarily same as the service name (they are derived from it though); you can check running cont's with `docker <container> ps`.\n\n### Running without Docker\n\nCan be done, but needlessly cumbersome. Ask Paavo for the how.\n\n\n### Starting a new client build from scratch\n\nIf you want to start the client build from scratch, for example with typescript checking enabled, run:\n\n```bash\ndeno run -A npm:sv@latest create client\n```\n\nfrom the root directory, and choose from the given options. For this project, we have used the most minimal build setup (SveleteKit minimal, no TS typechecking, nothing added, with deno itself for dependency management).\n",

  "./App/backend-tests/README.md": "### Endpoint tests\n\nTests for the phase of development when the frontend is incomplete. Helps in picking up on errors, exceptions and warnings. Relies on Pydantic and proper exception ahndling in the backend to be fully informative. Becomes somewhat obsolete after e2e-tests have been written.\n\nYou need to have the Eprice -app running if you want to run the tests. So call `docker compose up` to run the server (or with `-d server` flag, since front is not needed for these tests). If you run `docker compose up --build`, the backend tests **will not be started** as they are defined as a \"profile\" in compose file.\n\nTo run the tests, first build the container with `docker compose build` inside the backend-tests, or just by adding the `--build` and `-d` flags:\n\n```\ndocker compose up --build -d backend-tests\n```\n\nYou can also run them in various other ways, e.g., jointly with every other container:\n\n```\ndocker compose up --profile backend-tests\n```\n\nIf you do it this way, and we add tests that depend on the loaded data in the database, this can cause issues -- we need to specify in the compose file that the backend-tests depends on `database: service_healthy`.\n\nYou can also run the tests with\n\n```\ndocker compose run backend-tests\n```\n\nbut these will leave a \"orphan\" containers behind -- these can be removed with `--remove-orphans` flag. Docker will warn you is this is happening, and in any case it is good practice to keep an eye on dockers resource usage and dangling containers:\n\n```\ndocker ps # running containers\ndocker ps -a # all containers\ndocker inspect <container_name_or_id>\ndocker stats # resource usage\ndocker container prune # remove stopped containers (it prompts you)\ndocker system prune # remove unused images, networks (and volumes)\n```\n",

In order to run the engine, docker needs to load the *llama3.2* model first. It will be downloaded into `chat-engine/.ollama/` folder, which you need to create. However, do not include it in git. \n\nThe chat-engine uses uv as the default package manager, and it's included in the container also. The dependencies are in `pyproject.toml`, and if you prefer pip, you can always you that. However, remember to include you local virtualenvironment into .gitignore and .dockerignore.\n\n**This container is not run by default when you run the project using docker-compose**. To include the chat-engine, you need use a specific profile:\n\n```\ndocker compose --profile chat-engine up\n```\n\nYou should have `chat-engine/.env.development` with `OPENAI_API_KEY` defined -- it does not need to be a valid api key, any styring will do. This is due to llm client/interface compatibility (and only for now). Eventually, we will collect all env files into a single project env (at compose level).\n\nThe bash script `run.sh` is likely going to change before long, but for now it's used to manage the Ollama server inside the container.

It is designed to assist both developers\n    and those evaluating the project in understanding the codebase, answering questions, and providing insights.\n    There are two chat views available, both based on the same model (OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini).\n    Both models keep conversation history, so you can always ask follow-up questions to get more detailed answers.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"mb-4\">\n    In addition to LLM's, you can also access the code base and documentation directly yourself.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-2\">Streaming</h2>\n  <p class=\"mb-4\">\n    A sreaming chat with access to the documents and the codebase (traditional chat view).\n    Based on a user query, the model retrieves relevant code snippets and\n    other documentatation related to the query. The retrieved content is then ranked and\n    only the most relevant texts are passed to the model as context information.\n    The model then generates a response based on the provided context. \n  </p>\n    <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-2\">Agent</h2>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">\n    An agent-based chat that uses the same model as the streaming chat, but with a different approach.\n    The agent can access the codebase and documentation using tool-calls, allowing it to retrieve relevant information dynamically.\n    This allows for more flexible and dynamic interactions, as the agent can provide insights and answers without being limited to\n    pre-defined context. The agent can also perform other actions for the user, such as searching the codebase or documentation,\n    and even generate UML diagrams based on the code structure.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-2\">Files</h2>\n  <p class=\"mb-4\">\n    A view that allows you to scroll through the files in the codebase and documentation.\n    You can click on the files to view their contents. Both chat views have access to the same files,\n    and understand the directory structure of the codebase.\n</div>\n",

This way the backend server is not needlessly burdened with dataloading on launch.\n\nThe service can be run using profile `data-preparation` (depends on database and migrations).\n\n**If dangling/orphan containers cause problems:** You can remove them by adding the `--remove-orphans` flag for compose. If you want to populate the database with your own scripts, you should start by tearing down (with the above flag), and then re-build. You can use a profile, or target the service with `-d data-preparation` argument for compose up.",

  "./App/user-chat/README": "## User chat for Eprice app\n\n**The user chat is a place-holder chat, and only has a very small llm powering it (one of the smallest llama models)**. The purpose is to simply show how easy the integration can be. \n\nThis folder has the dockerfile for ollama llm engine, and a minimal gradio dashboard implementation. In order to run the engine, docker needs to load the *llama3.2* model first. It will be downloaded into `user-chat/.ollama/` folder, which you need to create. However, do not include it in git. \n\nThe chat-engine uses uv as the default package manager, and it's included in the container also. The dependencies are in `pyproject.toml`, and if you prefer pip, you can always you that. However, remember to include you local virtualenvironment into .gitignore and .dockerignore.\n\n**This container is not run by default when you run the project using docker-compose**. To include the chat-engine, you need use a specific profile:\n\n```\ndocker compose --profile user-chat up\n```\n\nYou should have `user-chat/.env.development` with `OPENAI_API_KEY` defined -- it does not need to be a valid api key, any styring will do. This is due to llm client/interface compatibility (and only for now). Eventually, we will collect all env files into a single project env (at compose level).\n\nThe bash script `run.sh` is likely going to change before long, but for now it's used to manage the Ollama server inside the container. You can connect directly into the container with `docker exec -it user-chat bash` or something of that nature.\n",

  "./Documents/backend_design.md": "# Controller-Service-Repository Pattern & CRUD: An Overview\n\n## Introduction\n\nModern web applications often separate concerns into distinct layers to improve maintainability, testability, and scalability. One popular approach in the backend is the controller-service-repository pattern. This pattern is especially useful for applications with complex business logic and database interactions. We are aiming to comply with this design pattern in the project.\n\nA server that serves a Svelte frontend can use this pattern to handle requests—especially those involving sensitive information — securely and efficiently.\n\n## The Layers Explained\n\n1. **Controller**\n\n   - **Role:** Handles HTTP requests and responses.\n   - **Responsibility:** Receives input from the client (e.g., a Svelte form), calls the appropriate service methods, and returns the result.\n   - **Example:** The controller defines endpoints such as `/api/auth/register` and `/api/auth/login`. These endpoints receive user data, call the service layer, and return JSON responses.\n   - **Error Handling:** Exceptions are mainly caught at the controller level. The controller always returns valid JSON to the frontend, including appropriate error messages when necessary, while avoiding leaking sensitive information.\n\n2. **Service**\n\n   - **Role:** Contains business logic.\n   - **Responsibility:** Implements the core functionality of the application, such as validating credentials, generating tokens, or sending emails. It orchestrates calls to the repository and other utilities.\n   - **Example:** The service layer handles password hashing, verification code generation, and calls to the repository for user data. It may also send emails after successful registration or code updates.\n\n3. **Repository**\n\n   - **Role:** Manages data persistence.\n   - **Responsibility:** Handles all interactions with the database. It provides methods for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on data models.\n   - **Example:** The repository provides methods like `get_user_by_email`, `create_user`, `verify_code`, and `update_code` to interact with the `users` table in the database.\n\n## CRUD Operations\n\nCRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete—the four basic operations for persistent storage.\n\n- **Create:** Add new records (e.g., registering a new user).\n- **Read:** Retrieve records (e.g., fetching a user by email).\n- **Update:** Modify existing records (e.g., updating a verification code).\n- **Delete:** Remove records (for example, deleting a user).\n\n### Example: Authentication Flow\n\n1. **Register (Create)**\n    - Controller: Receives registration data from the Svelte frontend.\n    - Service: Hashes the password, generates a verification code, and calls the repository to create the user.\n    - Repository: Inserts the new user into the database.\n\n2. **Login (Read)**\n    - Controller: Receives login credentials.\n    - Service: Fetches the user by email and verifies the password.\n    - Repository: Retrieves the user record from the database.\n\n3. **Verify Email (Update)**\n    - Controller: Receives a verification code.\n    - Service: Calls the repository to update the user's verification status.\n    - Repository: Updates the `is_verified` field in the database.\n\n## Why Use Controller-Service-Repository Pattern?\n\n- **Separation of Concerns:** Each layer has a single responsibility, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.\n- **Testability:** Business logic can be tested independently from HTTP and database layers.\n- **Reusability:** Services and repositories can be reused across different controllers or even applications.\n- **Security:** Sensitive operations (like authentication) are handled server-side, reducing exposure to the client.\n- **Consistent Error Handling:** Exceptions are caught at the controller level, and valid JSON responses are always returned to the frontend, including appropriate error messages without leaking sensitive details.\n\n## How It Works with Svelte\n\nA Svelte frontend can use form actions and server-side calls for sensitive or restricted operations. When a user submits a form (such as login or register), the request is sent to the FastAPI backend, which processes it through the controller-service-repository pipeline. This ensures data is validated, business rules are enforced, and database operations are performed securely.\n\n## Summary Diagram\n\n```plantuml\n@startuml\n[Svelte Form] --> [Controller (FastAPI Route)]\n[Controller (FastAPI Route)] --> [Service (Business Logic)]\n[Service (Business Logic)] --> [Repository (Database Access)]\n[Repository (Database Access)] --> [Database]\n@enduml\n```\n\nThis pattern helps build robust, maintainable, and secure web applications, especially when handling authentication and other sensitive operations.",

  "./Documents/project_description.md": "# Project Overview\n\nThis is a software development project for Taitotalo's Python programmer course. We develop a web application using container technology, with Svelte and JavaScript frontend (using deno), FastAPI backend, Postgres database with vector extension, Flyway migrations, Playwright e2e-tests, Pytest backend tests, and a chat-engine (HuggingFace, Langchain and OpenAI). A concise description of the project is given in this document, but more technical information can be found from `./App/README.md`.\n\n\n## Application Overview\n\nEprice is an application that show users market electricity price and additional related information, such as electricity consumption and production. For non-registered users, only the current 24 hour period is covered, and only the market price is shown. For registered users, also historical data is available for market price and for production/consumption. The data is represented with graphs and statistics.\n\nFor registered users there is also a chat-engine available, which has access to specific source material, and which augments the user queries with retrieved context information. \n\n---\n\n## Services Overview\n\nThe system consists of multiple containerized services that work together to provide functionality for the Eprice application, including a database, backend server, client application, and additional components for migrations, testing, and a chat engine.\n\n### 1. Database\n- **Ports**: `5432` (default PostgreSQL port)\n- **Purpose**: Stores application data, including user information and embeddings for retrieval.\n\n### 2. Database Migrations\n- **Purpose**: Handles database schema migrations.\n- **Depends On**: `Database`\n\n### 3. Server\n- **Ports**: `8000`\n- **Purpose**: Provides backend APIs for the client and other services.\n- **Depends On**: `Database`\n- **Additional Functionality**: Makes external API calls.\n\n### 4. Client\n- **Ports**: `5173` (Svelte client)\n- **Purpose**: Frontend application for user interaction.\n- **Depends On**: `Server`, `Chat Engine`\n\n### 5. E2E Tests\n- **Purpose**: Runs end-to-end tests for the system.\n- **Depends On**: `Client`\n\n### 6. User Chat\n- **Ports**: `7862`\n\n### (Extra) Chat Engine\n- **Ports**: `7860-7861`\n- **Purpose**: Provides a chat engine for interaction with the project. This is meant for developers and maintainers, not the app's end-users. Chat uses retrieval augmented generation, and the retriever has access to project documentation and code.\n- **Depends On**: `Database`\n\n---\n\n\n```plantuml\n\n@startuml\ntitle Main services and their interactions\nskinparam rectangle {\n    BackgroundColor #FDF6E3\n    BorderColor #586e75\n}\nskinparam cloud {\n    BackgroundColor #FDF6E3\n    BorderColor #586e75\n}\n\ncloud \"Docker Network\\nmanages networking\" as DockerNetwork\n\npackage \"Database Layer\" {\n    [Database] <<container>> \n    [Database Migrations] <<container>> \n}\n\npackage \"Backend Layer\" {\n    [Server] <<container>> \n    [User Chat] <<container>> \n}\n\npackage \"Frontend Layer\" {\n    [Client] <<container>> \n    [E2E Tests] <<container>> \n}\n\ncloud \"External APIs\" as ExternalAPIs\n\n[Database Migrations] --> [Database] : Applies migrations\n[Server] --> [Database] : Reads/Writes data\n[Client] --> [Server] : API calls (port 8000)\n[Client] --> [User Chat] : LLM service (port 7862)\n[E2E Tests] --> [Client] : Tests frontend\n[Server] --> ExternalAPIs : Makes external API calls\n\nnote right of Client\nRuns on port 5173\nend note\n\n@enduml\n```\n\n## Additional Services Overview\n\n### Data-preparation\n\n- **Purpose**: Can be used independently to retrieve or update data. Saves data to a location that is available to migrations and the database.\n\n### Backend-tests\n\n- **Purpose**: Can be used to test backend functionality independently from the frontend. Beyond fault testing, backend-tests also give additional information and warnings which would be hidden from the e2e-tests.\n- **Depends On**: Database and Server.\n\nThe backend tests are mainly for development purposes, as the e2e-tests should cover the main functionalities by the end of development.\n",
